#### Q4)
##### a)
1. This is an ordered list
2. Here is the second Item
3. This is the third Item

##### b)
This is a paragraph that I am practicing emphasis and inline codes. This is how I can write _Italics_ using underscores. We can use 2 underscore to write a __bold__ word. If we combine underscore with asterisks we can write down a **_bold Italics_** . Last but not the least is to create an inline code, using `back-ticks` around the word we want to highlight. 

##### c)
Here is the fenced code block:

```C++
String Name = "MahsaSharifi";
Cout<<Name<<endl;
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
